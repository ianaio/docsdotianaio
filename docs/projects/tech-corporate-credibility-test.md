## Overview

The **Tech Corporate Credibility Test** is a Rust-based framework for evaluating corporate credibility through metrics like transparency, ethics, and innovation. Launched on July 16, 2025, this one-month pilot (ending August 16, 2025, with analysis published on August 17, 2025) assesses corporate claims in energy efficiency and ergonomics, providing actionable insights for investors, corporations, and researchers.

:::info Stub Crate
This project is available as a **stub crate** on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/tech-corporate-credibility-test), offering documentation and a minimal API. For the full implementation, including advanced metric calculations and integration with developer UX tools, contact [projects@iana.io](mailto:projects@iana.io) to obtain a commercial license. See the [licensing tiers](https://github.com/ianaio/Tech-Corporate-Credibility-Test/blob/main/tier.md) for details.

## Purpose

The Tech Corporate Credibility Test provides a robust toolkit for assessing corporate credibility, offering:

- **Library**: Use the `tech_corporate_credibility_test` crate for programmatic integration into Rust projects.
- **CLI Binary**: Run `tech-corporate-credibility-test` for standalone command-line report generation.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Access metrics and reports, with proprietary features available under a commercial license.

The stub crate on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/tech-corporate-credibility-test) provides a minimal API, while the full version (available via [projects@iana.io](mailto:projects@iana.io)) includes advanced features like API integration and web applications (planned for Q4 2025).
