Overview of the technology used in IanaIO.

- **Rust**: Our core language for safety and performance, used in projects like the [Tech Corporate Credibility Test](/docs/projects/tech-corporate-credibility-test).
- **WebAssembly (WASM)**: Enables high-performance web applications, as seen in our [IanaIO Rust Crates](/docs/crates/ianaiorust).
- **AI Integrations**: Powering tools like the [SmartEditOS Developer UX Layer](/docs/projects/smarteditos-developer-ux-layer).

Weâ€™re actively exploring AI-driven workflows and Rust-based CLI tools. Recent work includes enhancing the [SmartEditOS Developer UX Layer](/docs/projects/smarteditos-developer-ux-layer) for conversational AI, boosting developer productivity.

Learn how to use our technologies with the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide.
