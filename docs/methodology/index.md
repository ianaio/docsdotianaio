# IanaIO Methodology

Our approach to development combines agility, transparency, and innovation to deliver impactful solutions.

## Core Principles

- **Transparency**: Open documentation and clear metrics, as in the [Tech Corporate Credibility Test](/projects/tech-corporate-credibility-test).
- **Agility**: Iterative development cycles to adapt to emerging technologies.
- **Innovation**: Leveraging Rust and AI to push boundaries, as seen in [SmartEditOS](/projects/smarteditos-developer-ux-layer).

## Latest Practices

We’ve refined our agile workflows to support AI-driven projects, ensuring rapid iteration and high-quality outputs. Recent blog posts detail our methodology for Rust-based CLI tools.
